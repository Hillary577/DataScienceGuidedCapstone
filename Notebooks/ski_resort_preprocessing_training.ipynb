    "In preceding notebooks, we performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. We found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. We determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was our primary aim. We threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. We didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "This notebook starts to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, we start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Our first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. We then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, we've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. We could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise we were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, we have a somewhat independent assessment of how our model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. We could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if we kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, we might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

The linear model found k = 8 features resulted in best performance, and those features were (positive): vertical_drop, snow making_ac, total chairs, fastQuads, runs, and longest run. Trams and skiable terrain were negatively valenced, although there could be different reasons for this -- skiable terrain might mean larger resort, and thus more customers and the ability to charge less per ticket price.\n",
